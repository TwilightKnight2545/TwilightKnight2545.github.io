                    <h1>So You’re Moving Out Of Your Parents’ Basement!</h1>
                    <p class="credits">MJ Wickstrom</p>
                    <p>
                        Everyone knows that for most people, at some point in your life the time will come for you to move out from your parents' home. It's practically a stereotype for teenagers to either be kicked out of the house when they turn eighteen, or for them to reside in their parent’s basement until their mid-thirties. And while the messaging is often mixed about how one should feel about this, the fact is that at the end of the day, most people will need to move out at some point. For many people, that time is when they start college. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, if you’re here because you’re a soon-to-be, or even current college student who’s planning to move out into the big wide world, you probably understand just how challenging that can be. Finding a place to live, a job that will pay enough to cover rent and keep the lights on, managing the incredible levels of stress that come with being an adult in a world seemingly determined to make you want to drive your head into the nearest brick wall and then charging you for it… it can be a lot, and that’s on top of the whole “being a college student thing.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This guide will not be a magic Get-Out-Of-Adulting-Free card. What this guide will do however, is give you the basics that you need to know when starting out, help you in making a plan that is tailored to your goals and needs, and hopefully lighten your spirits thanks to the non-stop sarcastic comments from the wise-crack whose writing it (That’s me!).
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>Is This Guide JUST For College Students?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Absolutely not! This guide focuses on College Students, but the principles themselves apply to everyone. If you’re moving to be closer to your job, this guide applies to you. If this isn’t your first time moving out, this guide will still have something for you. Now, not all the options mentioned may apply to you specifically. For example, student dorms aren’t exactly an option if you aren’t attending college. However, most of the information in this guide should prove at least somewhat useful to you, regardless of your demographic.
