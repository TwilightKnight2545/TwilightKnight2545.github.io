                    <h1>Handling Your #1 Enemey (Spoiler, It's You. But It Doesn't Have to Be!)</h1>
                    <p class="credits">MJ Wickstrom</p>
                        <p>
                            Brace yourself for the hottest take ever: Your personal well-being is rather important actually.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I know, I know, Iâ€™m a genius, give me a Nobel Peace Prize, because I just cracked the code of life. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In all seriousness though, your mental health is indeed extremely important, as it impacts all areas of your life. Youâ€™ll be in a far better position to handle the many challenges presented by life if you arenâ€™t busy fighting with your own brain.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Itâ€™s fairly common knowledge that reported poor mental health has been spiking for a while now, with the members of Generation Z, racial and ethnic minorities, and LGBTQIA+ individuals being disproportionately affected.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, the neat thing about your mental health is that you are able to affect it! If you put in the effort, good mental health is entirely achievable for everyone! Now, everyone is different and has different situations, but there is some generally applicable advice that can be given:
                        </p>
                    <h3>Take Care of Your Body</h3>
                        <p>
                            Alright, time to start with the piece of advice that most people know, and roll their eyes at because it seems so obvious. Making sure that you have a healthy meal and get proper exercise is a sure way to boost your mental well-being. While this advice may seem easier said than done, given that we can often feel in a constant rush to get things done, things like eating proper meals and getting exercise can easily fall by the wayside.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, physical activity and healthy eating is indeed important, so finding ways to integrate them into your daily life is important. Luckily, itâ€™s not actually all that complicated to make these changes. Letâ€™s start with healthy eating.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of the biggest roadblocks many people run into is simply deciding on what to eat at any given time. The truth is that with a little bit of planning and effort, cooking a delicious, healthy meal is not only easy, but isnâ€™t even all that time consuming. Many people fall into the trap of thinking that cooking is too complicated or difficult for them, when in reality, once you select a recipe, its as simple as following a list of easy instructions. As long as you have some standard ingredients and a recipe, you can make a delicious meal within an hour tops. If you need some ideas, check out our <a href="pages/food/#search" class="in-text-link">Meal Planning</a> page for a list of easy, affordable recipes, as well as more information on how to plan meals in advance to reduce stress!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Exercise can also be relatively simple to incorporate into your daily routine, though it may not be what youâ€™re expecting. While doing full on exercises at the gym is definitely good for your physical health, getting good exercise can be as simple as going for a short walk on a break or after you get home. A half-hour walk each day can both be an excellent way to get some light exercise in, as well as a great opportunity to take a break from your day and get some fresh air.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Other ways to get some physical activity without having to splurge on a gym membership or any other workout equipment is simple body weight exercises such as squats, planks, push-ups, etc. There are also numerous free apps that provide easy workouts that can be done without equipment!
                        </p>

                    <h3>Stay Connected</h3>
                        <p>
                            Humans are social animals. We work best in communities where we can interact with our peers on a regular basis. This is part of the reason why the populationâ€™s mental health dropped heavily during the Covid-19 lockdown. We arenâ€™t meant to be isolated for long periods of time. There is a reason that solitary confinement is considered a form of torture. So why subject yourself to it?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Being a part of a community has been shown to have a positive effect on a personâ€™s mental wellbeing. Communities provide support, a sense of belonging, and often an aspiration or goal to work towards. Finding a group of like minded people with common values, beliefs, or interests can do wonders for your mental wellbeing. The only question that remains is how do you find/make them?
                        </p>

                            If you are a college student, a great place to start is by checking out student life programs. Many colleges will have a variety of clubs that you can join, as well as student events throughout the year that you can take part in. Taking part in activities that are of interest to you are a great way to find more people who share your interests, which can be an excellent way to form friendships.

                        <h4>Journaling</h4>
                        <p>
                            One great way to improve your mental health and practice mindfulness is journaling. With so much happening in our lives, taking the time to sit down and write down your thoughts, feelings, and frustrations from the day can help you organize yourself. Journaling provides a way to get your thoughts out on paper, and it can help you reflect on your day. If your having a bad week, writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you identify and handle stress triggers. It can also help you prioritize any problems or goals you might have, and help you get closer to a solution. If your feeling adrift, try grabbing a pen and paper and taking ten minutes each day to write down the thoughts that are swirling in your mind. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>Creative Outlets</h4>
                        <p>
                            Much like journaling, finding a way to creatively express yourself can be a wonderful method of improving your mental health in a variety of ways. Visual art methods such as drawing, painting, or woodworking can be a great way to use your hands, serving both as a creative outlet, and a form of meditation. Performing arts such as acting, dancing, or music are great forms of emotional release, and also provide the oppurtunity to interact with others and form a community around your shared interests. Creative writing, just like journaling, can also provide a way to express your thoughts and emotions in a safe environment. These are just a few examples, but there are dozens of different outlets that may suit you better!
