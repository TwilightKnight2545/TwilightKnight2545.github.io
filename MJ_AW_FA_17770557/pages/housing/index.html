                    <h1>Getting a Roof Over Your Head</h1>
                    <p class="credits">MJ Wickstrom</p>

                    <p>
                        I'm not going to beat around the bush. Now is not an easy time to find a place to live. The economy is as instable as it's ever been, rent is through the roof, and actually buying a place to live is a pipe-dream for many right now. Most of the old rules on how much to spend on housing simply don't work in today's word. As of this article being written, we are in wholly unprecedented times at the moment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even in stable times, finding housing that works for you is highly variable, depending on where you live, how old you are, your income, among other considerations. There will not be any one fit-all answer, nor is there much in the way of broadly-applicable advice. The best I can offer is an overview of the options and tools available, and get you started on researching the question further for your own situation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With that stated, let's get into things...
                    </p>

                    <h2>Only Get What You Need</h2>
                    <p>
                        Especially when starting out, almost every homebuyer is working with limited resources at their disposal. College students especially are on a budget when finding their first home. While this is hardly news to you, dear reader, it is still the reality of the situation that your first home cannot have everything you could possibly want or need. Such a home simply does not exist unless you happen to have millions of dollars just lying around. So when you're looking to find your new home, you need to consider what your needs are, and what your wants are. Here's a few things to consider to get you started:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Are you looking for a short-term or a long term home?</li>
                        <li>How close to your job and/or school are you?</li>
                        <li>Do you need a place that comes with appliances and furniture?</li>
                        <li>Do you want to live in your town/city, or would you prefer to be more secluded?</li>
                        <li>Do you have the time to do home maintentce?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Renting vs. Buying</h2>
                    <p>
                        
                    </p>
                    <h2>Roommates: Pros vs. Cons</h2>
                    <p>
                        
                    </p>
