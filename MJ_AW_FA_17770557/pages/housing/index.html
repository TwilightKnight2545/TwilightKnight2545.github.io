                    <h1>Getting a Roof Over Your Head</h1>
                    <p class="credits">MJ Wickstrom</p>

                    <p>
                        I'm not going to beat around the bush. Now is not an easy time to find a place to live. The economy is as instable as it's ever been, rent is through the roof, and actually buying a place to live is a pipe-dream for many right now. Most of the old rules on how much to spend on housing simply don't work in today's word. As of this article being written, we are in wholly unprecedented times at the moment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even in stable times, finding housing that works for you is highly variable, depending on where you live, how old you are, your income, among other considerations. There will not be any one fit-all answer, nor is there much in the way of broadly-applicable advice. The best I can offer is an overview of the options and tools available, and get you started on researching the question further for your own situation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With that stated, let's get into things...
                    </p>

                    <h2>Only Get What You Need</h2>
                    <p>
                        Especially when starting out, almost every homebuyer is working with limited resources at their disposal. College students especially are on a budget when finding their first home. While this is hardly news to you, dear reader, it is still the reality of the situation that your first home cannot have everything you could possibly want or need. Such a home simply does not exist unless you happen to have millions of dollars just lying around. So when you're looking to find your new home, you need to consider what your needs are, and what your wants are. Here's a few things to consider to get you started:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Are you looking for a short-term or a long term home?</li>
                        <li>How close to your job and/or school are you?</li>
                        <li>Do you need a place that comes with appliances and furniture?</li>
                        <li>Do you want to live in your town/city, or would you prefer to be more secluded?</li>
                        <li>Do you have the time to do home maintentce?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Renting vs. Buying</h2>
                    <p>
                        The age old debate of which is better, Batman vs. Superâ€” oh whoops, wrong topic! Where was Iâ€¦ oh right! Renting vs Buying, and which is better. So which is it? Well, it's complicated. There are several factors that must be considered when deciding which path makes more sense for youâ€¦
                    </p>
                    <h4>Initial Costs</h4>
                    <p>
                        Most everyone understands that in that in the short run, buying a house is more expensive than renting a home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2024/09/acs-rent-burden.html" target="_blank" class="in-text-link">According to US Census Bureau economist Jacob Fabina</a>, as of 2023, the median rent cost was $1,406; and the median home value was $340,200. Going off of this data, the average person renting a home in 2023 would be paying a security deposit of anywhere between $1.5k to $3.5k, and around $1.5k every month. Contrasting this, a person buying an average house in 2023 would be paying about a $68,000 down payment (20% of total value), and monthly mortgage payments between $1.7k and $3.5k per month, depending on how many years the payments are stretched out for.
                    </p>
                
                    <h4>Long-Term v. Short-Term</h4>
                    <p>
                        Another fairly well known fact, buying a house is a solid long-term investment. Once fully paid for, you own it, plain and simple. Aside from property taxes, unless your in a homeowners association, you don't have to make any more payments for your home. If you plan to settle down in an area, buying a house can save you money in the long-run. Using the 2023 median prices from earlier, after roughly eighteen years and paying off the house, buying becomes cheaper than renting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, the flipside of this is that renting is far better in the short term. If you're say, just living in one place while you're attending university and then plan to move to find work elsewhere, renting makes far more sense. If something comes up, such as a unexpected job-oppurtunity, or moving to be closer to a loved one, it is far easier to adapt if your renting a place, as opposed to having to find a buyer to sell your home to.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="helpful-hint">
                    <h4>
                        ðŸ’¡Editor's Note
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        While not true 100% of the time, generally speaking, costs, including rent, tend to be cheaper in less populated areas. This is largely due to demand for housing correlating with the population of the area. The more people there are looking for a home, the more landlords and real-estate companies can get away with charging.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keep this in mind when factoring in the likely cost of living for your area!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="article">
                    <h2>Roommates: Pros vs. Cons</h2>
                    <p>
                        Especially when starting out, an incredibly easy way to cut down on your housing expenses is to split the bill. Jointly renting a 3-bedroom apartment with two other friends, as an example, can be half the cost per person compared to each person renting a 1-bedroom apartment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On top of saving money by splitting bills, living with others (provided you get along with them and enjoy their company) can also be great for your mental health, and overall can be a very enjoyable experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, there is that caveat. Roomates <i>can</i> great, but bad roomates can really sour an experience. If you're looking to find roomates, it's not a bad idea to do a bit of looking around to see if you think you would be compatible and get along, or if your personalities or any other factor could cause friction and conflict. Be sure to set clear expectations for both of you, and make sure that both parties understand what is expected. If you want a roomate, make sure that you are able to clearly communicate with them and be able to reach compromises. Saving a few hundred dollars on rent each month is not always worth it if it makes you miserable all the time.
