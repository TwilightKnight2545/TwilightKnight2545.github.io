                    <h1>Makin' Your Way Downtown, Walkin' Fast...</h1>
                    <p>
                        There are two hard truths in life. The first is that the title of the page is a reference to a song from over twenty years ago, and will definately date this website. And the second, being that you cannot live life solely in the comfort of your home. You will have to get out of your house to go about your daily life, and you will need to a way to get from place to place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now there's a good chance you just read that paragraph and rolled your eyes. "Well duh," you might have said, "<i>that's what my car is for!</i>"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And to that, I'll say, sure you have a point. But think about it. How much is your car costing you every time you need to run an errand, or get to work, or even just by going for a drive? Gasoline is not cheap, especially in today's economic climate, and fuel aside, vehicles don't last forever. Every mile you drive is one step closer to an inevitable breakdown, leaving you having to fork over hundreds or even thousands for a repair, or to purchase a new vehicle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, if you don't live in a major city, it's likely you'll still want to have access to a car of your own, as rural alternatives to a personal vehicle are often quite lacking, and even if you are living in a city, there may still be ocasions where a car or truck would be beneficial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The point of this section is not that you shouldn't own a personal vehicle. Rather, what I'm getting at is that if you don't absolutely need to use your car for any given task, say to haul lots of groceries, or visit family an hour or more away, consider using alternatives to a personal vehicle.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Some Alternatives To Cars...</h2>
                    <div class="helpful-hint">
                        <h4>
                            ðŸ’¡Editor's Note
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            It should be noted that the following options are highly dependent on where you live. Check what options are avaliable to you in your local area, and/or where you plan to move. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A good rule of thumb is that the more rural the area, the more reliant on a personal vehichle you will be, and the less alternatives will be available. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Public Transportaion</h3>
                    <p>
                        Looking into public transportation in your local area would be considered a wise move. If you live in most any city, odds are there will be several bus routes that can take you within walking distance anywhere in the city. And if you live in a major metropolitan area, a subway may also be an option. Both are typically cheaper than the cost of gas, insurance, and maintenance for a car, and have the added benefit of avoiding the stress of navigating urban traffic.
                    </p>

                    <h3>These Boots Were Made For Walking...</h3>
                    <p>
                        As long as you don't live in the middle of nowhere, walking is typically a perfectly acceptable method to travel short distances, say if you live nearby to your job or college. Now while walking is slower than a vehicle (feels like that should go without saying), the benefits of traveling on foot can be worth it if you are able. For one, walking is free, and many cities and towns are designed to be at least somewhat walkable, especially in major cities. Granted, US cities aren't as walkable as say, European cities, but most are still fairly manageable. Walking has also been shown to have a positive impact on your mental health, and is a great way to get some casual exercise in.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Biking</h3>
                    <p>
                        Bicylces strike a balance between walking and driving your car. They are faster than walking, and cheaper than driving. In many small towns, there is typically low enough traffic that biking is fairly doable, and in larger towns its more likely for there to be infastructure in place such as bike lanes to make it easier as well. Bicycles also serve as excellent way to work some exercise into your daily commute.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can often find a used bike for a very affordable price at thrift stores, bike shops, or online. If you choose to use a bicycle, make sure you wear a helmet, wear visible clothes, especially at night, and have lights and/or reflectors on your bicycle.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Motorcycles</h3>
                    <p>
                        Nope. Just don't. It's not worth it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Motorcycles are across the board more dangerous than cars, they require an additional license to drive, require more maintenance, require safety gear, and have limited storage, and that's just scratching the surface. Now, could you get a motorcycle if you really wanted to? Yes. But for someone just moving out of the house, likely with a tight budget, it's really not a greate idea.
                    </p>

                    <h2>...But If You Really Need To Buy One</h2>
                    <p>
                        As mentioned before, while it is nice to use alternatives to cars to save money, in many cases a car will be necessary to have as an option, either for longer commutes, traveling outside of your town/city to get to work, or to haul groceries or run other errands. Knowing that, you should know what to look for when purchasing a vehicle, assuming you don't already have one.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Identify Your Needs</h4>
                    <p>
                        Ask yourself what you need your vehicle for, and use your answer to narrow down what kind of vehicle to look for. Are you planning to use your vehicle to haul large loads on the regular, or just to commute from place to place. Will you be going off-road? If you don't need to go off-road or carry much more than groceries, than you don't likely don't need a truck, and can save money by selecting a car, which on average are both cheaper, and get better milage. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Never Buy New</h4>
                    <p>
                        Especially starting out, never buy a new car off of the dealership lot. Used vehicles being cheaper aside, the value of a new vehicle immediately plummets the minute you drive off the lot. If you ever intend to sell your vehicle in the future, and want to get the most return on your investment, a used vehicle will almost be preffarable.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Pay it Off Immediately</h4>
                    <p>
                        Ideally when buying a car, you'll be able to pay for it in cash, in one transaction. However, I recognize that that isn't always an option, and that you may need to finance your car. If that is the case, pay it off as soon as you can. Always make more than the minimum monthly payment, and make sure not to miss a single payment. Lenders make their money off of you messing up, and they are certainly not your friends.

                    <h2>Basic Vehicle Maintenance</h2>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, once you have a vehicle, making sure you keep it in good condition is key to make it last longer. Changing the oil every 3-6k miles and roating tires every 5-10k miles will help prolong your car's life. If the option is avaliable, storing it in a garage as opposed to outside will protect it from severe weather and low temperatures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For most small things like oil changes, rotating tires, etc, you will be able to do yourself. There are several resources online that can show you how to do small repairs, and will save you time and money from taking your vehicle into a repair shop, which often charge excessively for simply repairs. If you have a friend or family member that knows how to work on a vehicle, it's worth asking them as well, as they will often be willing to do it either cheaper than most repair shops.
